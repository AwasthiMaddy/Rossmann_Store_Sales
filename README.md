# Rossmann_Store_Sales
Project: Kagggle - Rossmann Store Sales Prediction

Time Frame - Oct, 2015 - Dec, 2015

Objective: Predict Sales of 1100 different drug stores belonging to three different store-types and spanning over 
28 cities in Germany. We had data for a total of 152 weeks with intermittent weeks missing for a number of stores, and we were to
forecast the daily sales for next 6 weeks. This competition was a perfect ground for us to test the classical time series 
models along with fancy machine learning algorithms.

Evaluation metric: Root Mean Squared Percentage Error (RMSPE)

Our team: Bishwarup Bhattacharjee - Markus Dohring - Peter Borrman

Total number of participating teams: 3303

Our final standing : 10

Minimum RMSPE achieved: 0.10710
